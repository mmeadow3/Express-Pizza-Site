This is how to mimic an http server in the command line

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log( "[", new Date().toString(), "]" );
  console.log(req.method, "/" , req.headers["user-agent"]);
  next()
})

middleware is used to respond to a request object then send it back

can also have route specific middleware by providing a path

req, res, next ------ the next makes it middleware
